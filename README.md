# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  - Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over         300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.


### Purpose

- Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.



## Analysis and Challenges
  Some of the analysis and challenges i encountered on this projects was ability to make precise readible pivot tables along with getting proper trendlines on line graph so we can make future refrences based upon our pivot tables feeding us quick data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
