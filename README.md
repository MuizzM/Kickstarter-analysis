# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  - Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over         300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.


### Purpose

- Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.



## Analysis and Challenges
  Some of the analysis and challenges i encountered on this projects was ability to make precise readible pivot tables along with getting proper trendlines on line graph so we can make future refrences based upon our pivot tables feeding us quick data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 -In this graph trendline we monitor our graph for being succeful in theater category in the hottest months of the year by looking at the trendlines we can monitor those and make a decision baased upon our graph.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   -Attached above of line graph. As we can see we started of very strong becuase our goal reached amount was low and very achievable by many of the kickstarter           campaign.But as we move further down the goal we can see a divergence in our graph. The graphs tends to bottom out with succesful and failed goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

***What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*** 
 -The first conclusion is theater category makes a run during the spring to summer months as theater kickstarter succesful rate is very high but as we get to colder months of the year our trendlines goes down based upon our succes rate of the campaign goal.
 - The second conclusion would be that our failed rate goal trendline is very constant theought the year due to the kickstarter ability to help promote more theater campaign.

***What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*** 

 - Succesful rates are very high if the goals is below $1000. But once we get above $50000 our failed rate beats the succesful rate by huge margins

***What are some limitations of this dataset?*** 
- There are several outliers in the funding goal/target amounts of money for several categories/subcategories. While we have ‘blurbs’ for each Kickstarter campaign, it would be helpful to have more detailed information into what each Kickstarter hopes to accomplish (in terms of actionable items). It might not be worth including both campaigns with ambitious/expensive goals and campaigns with smaller/cheap goals in the same study.

-the dataset does not have much information on what donors expect to receive in exchange for their donations (e.g. a product prototype, tickets to a production, t-shirts, etc.). It could impact a donor’s decision to donate if she/he believes she/he will receive something significant in exchange for her/his donation.

- ***What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*** 
 - Graphs for all the metrics covered with and without “plays” (the most popular category).
 -Tables showing the most successful categories/subcategories versus the most unsuccessful categories/subcategories and detailed data into each category/subcategory’s level of success. Some possible metrics include (1) success rate per category/subcategory, (2) median, max, and min funding goal/target per category/subcategory, (3) median, max, and min of average donation per category/subcategory, (4) median, max, and min of percent funded per category/subcategory, (5) median, max, and min length of Kickstarter campaign timelines per category/subcategory etc.
-	Displays showing the average timelines (how much time companies/organizations have to complete the Kickstarter campaigns) for the most successful and least successful types of programs (perhaps having more time to achieve funding targets would lead to greater rates of success).
-	Displays and tables that exclude significant funding goal outliers.
-	Graphs and displays that break up each category into its specific subcategories to uncover what makes different types of organizations successful. Several categories are relatively broad so it might be that some subcategories within each category have significantly different funding goals, average donations, lengths of Kickstarter timelines, and take place during different periods of time (years and seasons). Breaking up each category into subcategories would help us better understand the data.
